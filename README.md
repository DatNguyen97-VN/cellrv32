## 1. Overview
![cellrv32 overview](https://github.com/DatNguyen97-VN/cellrv32/blob/main/doc/figures/cellrv32%20top.png)


The CELLRV32 Processor is a **customizable microcontroller-like system on chip (SoC)** built around the CELRV32
[RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) CPU and written in **platform-independent SystemVerilog**. The processor is intended as know about specific arrangement of registers, ALUs, finite state machines (FSMs), memories, and other logic building blocks needed to implement an RISC-V and building block from theoretical to combinational and sequential circuits for the internal IP. The project is intended to work _out of the box_ and targets
FPGA / RISC-V beginners.

Special focus is paid on **execution safety** to provide defined and predictable behavior at any time.
Therefore, the CPU ensures that _all_ memory accesses are properly acknowledged and that _all_ invalid/malformed
instructions are always detected as such. Whenever an unexpected situation occurs the application software is
informed via _precise and resumable_ hardware exceptions.


### Key Features

- [x] all-in-one package: **CPU** + **SoC** + **Software Framework & Tooling**
- [x] extensive configuration options for adapting the processor to the requirements of the application
- [ ] aims to be as small as possible while being as RISC-V-compliant as possible - with a reasonable area-vs-performance trade-off
- [x] FPGA friendly (e.g. _all_ internal memories can be mapped to block RAM - including the CPU's register file)
- [ ] optimized for high clock frequencies to ease integration / timing closure
- [x] from zero to _"hello world!"_ - completely open source and documented
- [x] easy to use even for FPGA / RISC-V starters â€“ intended to _work out of the box_
